# Computer-Vision_Basic-to-Advance
This repository contains a series of Python scripts demonstrating various basic computer vision tasks using OpenCV. Each script progressively introduces different concepts, from basic video handling to image processing, face detection, and motion detection.

# Scripts Overview

1. **01 Video Starting** - Basic script to initialize video capture from a webcam.
2. **01A StartVideo** - Enhanced version of the video capture initialization.
3. **01B StartVideo** - Another variant focusing on initializing and configuring video input.
4. **02 Getting Pictures** - Captures frames from a video stream and saves them as images.
5. **03 Rectangle** - Draws a rectangle on each frame, potentially for object tracking.
6. **04 Rect_line** - Extends the rectangle functionality by adding lines or other shapes to frames.
7. **05 Detect Face** - Detects faces in video frames using a face detection model.
8. **06 Capturing Image** - Captures and saves individual images from a live video feed.
9. **07 Flip_The_Video** - Flips the video feed horizontally or vertically.
10. **08 Motion_detector_pic** - Detects motion in a video feed and highlights moving objects.

# Prerequisites

- Python 3.x
- OpenCV library

# Usage

Each script can be run independently to test specific functionalities. Run the scripts in sequence to progressively build up your understanding of computer vision basics using OpenCV
